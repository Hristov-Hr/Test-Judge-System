# Test-Judge-System
The goal of this project is to build a system that automatically tests a user-provided solution against a predefined task and calculates the success rate of the tests. This project involves creating a testing framework using Python's unittest module, defining a task function, a user solution function, and a judge function to evaluate the solutions.
